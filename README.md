## ✨ What It Does
 
### Browse Treatments (`/services`)
Clients can explore the full treatment menu across four categories — **Skincare, Spa, Nails, and Hair**. The page includes a live smart filter panel:
- 🔍 Text search by treatment name or description
- 🎯 Filter by skin/body concern (glow, hydration, exfoliation, tension relief, grooming)
- ⏱️ Duration slider to find treatments that fit their schedule
- Each treatment card shows a photo, description, duration, and price — with a direct link to book
### Book an Appointment (`/book`)
A guided 3-step booking wizard:
1. **Pick a treatment** from the full service grid
2. **Choose a date and time** from available slots (10:00–19:00)
3. **Fill in contact details** — name, email, phone, and preferred contact method (Phone, WhatsApp, Viber, or Telegram)
On submission, the booking is saved to Supabase with a `pending` status, ready for the admin to confirm. The client sees a confirmation screen with their appointment summary.
 
### Standards & Reviews (`/standards`)
An editorial brand page with two purposes:
- Showcases the salon's **three core standards** (hygiene, certified mastery, the coffee & conversation ritual)
- Displays **verified guest reviews** fetched live from the database — only admin-approved ones appear publicly
- Guests can submit their own review (name, treatment, rating 1–5, written experience), which enters a moderation queue
- Each review card has a **like button** that increments live in the database
